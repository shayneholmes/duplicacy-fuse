# duplicacy-fuse

## Overview

This is my first effort at implementing a file system in userspace.

## Purpose

Allows snapshots and revisions on storage in a configured [duplicacy](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/) repository to be mounted (read-only) as a file system.

## Building

Should build and run on both Windows and Linux.

On Windows, it can be built with, or without CGO support using the CGO_ENABLED env var.

## Requirements

Check out [cgofuse](https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse) for full requirements, however basics are:

* Linux : gcc, libfuse-dev
* Windows (cgo) : [WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp), gcc
* Windows (!cgo)  : [WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp)

## CLI

### Building

```sh
go get -u gitlab.com/andrewheberle/duplicacy-fuse
```

Optional: To build the !cgo version on Windows, set the "CGO_ENABLED" environment variable to "0" before building.

### Usage

```sh
duplicacy-fuse <mount point> [options]
```

### Options

  `-o repository=<path>` : Path to repository. Defaults to current directory.

  `-o storage=<storage name>` : Remote storage to mount. Defaults to "default".

  `-o password=<storage password>`: Password for the specified storage.

  `-o snapshot=<id>` : Which snapshot id to mount. Unless `all` option is specified, defaults to the repository snapshot id for the chosen storage.

  `-o revision=<number>` : Which revision to mount. Cannot be specified when the `all` is specified. **Currently not working**

  `-o cachedir=<dir>` : Where to do caching via the KV store (currently uses [bitcask](https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitcask)) for revision contents. Defaults to `$HOME/.duplicacy-fuse` on Linux and `%USERPROFILE%\.duplicacy-fuse` on Windows.

  `-o cleancache` : Deletes cache contents on start.

  `-o all` : Display all snapshot ids for the specified storage.

## Library

```go
import (
  "github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse/fuse"
  "gitlab.com/andrewheberle/duplicacy-fuse/dpfs"
)

func main() {
  duplicacyfs := dpfs.NewDuplicacyfs()
  host := fuse.NewFileSystemHost(duplicacyfs)
  mountpoint := "/a/path"
  options := []string{"-o", "repository=/path/to/repo"}
  host.Mount(mountpoint, options)
}
```

## Status

Basic functionality seems to all work fine, although this has only been tested on Windows.

I've had a few unusual crashes when browsing the filesystem which I believe is due to concurrency issues.

Performance is quite slow when opening files.

## TODO

* Make SFTP storage using key based authentication work
* Tests - Implement tests for the various fuse methods (current ones for Getattr always fail)
* KV store is an Interface so potentially a better/faster option could be implemented.
* Cache snapshot ID and revisions for speedy top level browsing.
* Speed up directory listing by including direct descendants in folder key
* Speed up multiple accesses by caching actual data more than once: Keep ~5 chunks in LRU cache?
* Prefetch next chunk when reading to optimize for sequential read
